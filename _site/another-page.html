<hr>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>Several nations have taken a stance to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in their industrial processes and operations. Furthermore, these nations have committed to achieving carbon neutrality goals within a short duration. However, accounting for emissions requires technical support in the form of tools and applications that can prove use cases for effective city management. Urban Digital Twins (UDTs) integrate multiple disciplines to improve city system efficiency. Nevertheless, UDTs that explore decarbonisation initiatives for cities are limited, as the applications restrict themselves to the building level and have minimum access to authoritative 3D data at the city scale. We propose a methodology to build a UDT platform using a bottom-up integrated 3D city energy dataset based on OpenStreetMap and local public data portals in Singapore. Local datasets are used to gather building type, completion year, and energy consumption data. A linear equation is used to calculate the building’s operational GHG emissions based on energy modelling and the dataset. Each building is assigned a Singapore Region, Planning Area, and Subzone, this information allows city-scale analyses and data exploration. An interactive web map application with User Experience (UX) is developed for rapid heterogeneous data streaming. The UDT platform has a query system with three input scrollbars for quick access to the information—Planning Area, Built Year, and Building Typology. The UDT dashboard generates charts and visualisations based on GHG emissions calculation output. New scenarios such as low/high energy use and low GWP refrigerants in the future are created on top of the baseline (current energy use and technology). By using various interactive what-if scenarios for future scenarios, the UDT use case demonstration will help stakeholders develop GHG emission reduction and carbon-neutral strategies. The research provides a guideline to develop UDT applications around the world without or with limited authoritative open 3D datasets.</p>
