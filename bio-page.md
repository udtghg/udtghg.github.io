# Bio
`Pradeep Alva` is a Researcher and PhD Candidate at the Department of Architecture (DOA), <a href="https://cde.nus.edu.sg/arch/">National University of Singapore (NUS)</a> supervised by <a href="https://cde.nus.edu.sg/arch/staffs/rudi-stouffs-dr/">Prof Rudi Stouffs</a> and <a href="https://cde.nus.edu.sg/dbe/staff/clayton-miller-dr/">Prof Clayton Miller</a>. Currently, he is working within the <a href="https://frs.ethz.ch/research/urban-resilience/climate-resilience.html">Urban Climate Resilience</a> module, Future Resilient Systems II programme, Singapore-ETH Centre (SEC). He is focused on the research topic of `Urban Digital Twins (UDT)` and developing a 3D web map application called <a href="https://ghg.app.frs.ethz.ch/">GHG App</a>, which will serve as a user-experience dashboard for decision-makers involved in greenhouse gas <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4BFgtU0hJU">(GHG)</a> emission mitigation and decarbonising initiatives for cities. He was honoured with the Young CAADRIA Award in 2024 and nominated as the Young Leader for his contribution to academic research at the World Cities Summit 2024.

Before this, he was part of the course development team of an NUS-EdX professional certificate programme - <a href="https://www.edx.org/certificates/professional-certificate/nus-spatial-computational-thinking">"Spatial Computational Thinking"</a>, which teaches the theoretical knowledge and practical skills required for leveraging computation for the manipulation of various types of spatial data. He has previously worked on GIS modelling and software development of Planning Support Systems (PSS) at the Design Automation Lab, headed by Prof Patrick Janssen. Pradeep has performed complex GIS models and designed various geospatial urban planning decision-making frameworks. Using Python in the ArcGIS domain, he developed a set of tools as part of the research that can be used by city planners. He holds a master’s degree in integrated sustainable design from NUS, where he worked on research studio projects based in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. During which he studied existing ecosystems and urban models/networks to inform design decisions holistically that work towards a positive impact on the environment we live in.

Prior to joining NUS, he was a Project Architect in India where he was involved in executing renowned institutional and residential projects. Pradeep holds a bachelor’s degree in Architecture.
